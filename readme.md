# Portfolio Template

A simple, responsive portfolio template (HTML / CSS / JS). Replace placeholders with your details.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small interaction logic (menu, theme, footer year)
- `assets/` — place images here (profile.jpg, project-*.png)
- `resume.pdf` — (optional) put your resume in the root

## How to customize
1. Replace "YOUR NAME", email, and texts in `index.html`.
2. Add your profile photo to `assets/profile.jpg`.
3. Replace project cards (images, links, descriptions).
4. Update social links in the footer.
5. If you use the contact form, sign up at Formspree and replace the form `action` URL with your Formspree endpoint (or use a server endpoint).

## Accessibility & SEO tips
- Use descriptive `alt` attributes for images.
- Keep page title and meta description relevant.
- Use semantic elements and labels (already present).

## Deploy
- GitHub Pages: push the repo and enable Pages on the main branch.
- Netlify / Vercel: drag-and-drop or connect the repo and deploy.
- For GitHub Pages, ensure `index.html` is at the repo root or `docs/` folder.

## Extra ideas
- Add more projects with modal detail views.
- Add animated skill bars or testimonials.
- Hook contact form to your backend or a service like Getform / Formspree.

If you'd like, I can:
- personalize the page now (fill in your name, bio, projects if you provide them),
- convert this to React or a static site generator,
- or prepare a GitHub repo and push these files for you (please share the repo owner/name).
